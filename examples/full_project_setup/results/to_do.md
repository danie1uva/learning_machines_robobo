## Things still to do
1. If we leave the hardware expirement done as is, comment on the fact that in comparison to the simulation, 
the obstacles on both ends were different materials and so different reflective index - affects reality gap. Add this comment to slides or reconduct hardware experiment.

2. The plot combined_movements.png is weird: 
    - Why does IR measurement for frontal sensor hardware increase after threshold is reached i.e. device moving away from obstacle.
    - Why are all IR measurements 0 for frontal hardware in the first 4 updates. Doesn't seem right.

3. Given the above, we should probably reconduct hardware experiment.
